# PyBer_Analysis

## Background
The purpose of the analysis was to compare and contrast ride sharing data for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cites. The total rides, drivers, fares as well as average fare per ride and average fare per driver were calculated for each city type. In addition, the total fares by month for each city type was evaluated. The results of the analysis will provide information necessary to improve access to ride share services and improve affordability of the services.

## Results
### Summary by City Type
The total rides, drivers, and fares in urban cities far exceeded those of rural and suburban cities (Table 1). In fact, urban cities surpassed these metrics even when suburban and rural cities are combined. In addition, urban cities had a lower average fare per ride and a lower average fare per driver when compared to rural and suburban cities.

#### Table 1. Summary by City Type

### Total Fare by City Type
As discussed above, the total fares in urban cities far exceeded those of suburban and rural cities. Urban cities outperformed rurual and suburban cities in total fares each week of January through March 2019 (Figure 1). There is weekly variation in total fares for each city type, but urban cities always outperformed suburban cities and suburban cities always outperformed rural cities.

## Summary
From the data presented above, it is clear there are some disparities in ride access and ride costs for urban, suburban, and rural cities. Opportunities to reduce the disparities include:
1) Increase the total number of drivers available to serve both suburban and rural cities. Ideally, this would include shifting drivers from urban cities to the underserved suburban and rural cities.
2) Provide a discount or reduce fare rates for customers from suburban and rural cities.
3) Promote the services of PyBer in suburban and rural cities to increase utilization of the service. This may be more successful after implementing 1 and 2 above.
