# PyBer_Analysis

## Background
The purpose of the analysis was to compare and contrast ride sharing data for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cites. The total rides, drivers, fares as well as average fare per ride and average fare per driver were calculated for each city type. In addition, the total fares by month for each city type was evaluated. The results of the analysis will provide information necessary to improve access to ride share services and improve affordability of the services.

## Results
### Summary by City Type
The total rides, drivers, and fares in urban cities far exceeded those of rural and suburban cities (Table 1). In fact, urban cities surpassed these metrics even when rural and suburban cities are combined. In addition, urban cities had a lower average fare per ride and a lower average fare per driver when compared to rural and suburban cities.
